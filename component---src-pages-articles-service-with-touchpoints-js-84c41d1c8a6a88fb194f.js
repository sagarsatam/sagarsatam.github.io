Now what is a dabba? A dabba is simply a tiffin box (iconic stackable tin box) carrying home-cooked food, which is to be delivered from the home to a person in an office or a school. And a dabbawala is a person who picks up the food from the home, and ensures that it is delivered to the right office, to the right person on time. Every day, for a very modest fee, the dabbawalas collect freshly cooked meals from their customers’ homes all over Mumbai. Travelling by train, bus and bicycle, they then sort and deliver each of them to offices and workplaces throughout the city by lunchtime – and even return the used tiffins back to the customer’s home for reuse. It all may sound fairly simple, but imagine doing this in one of the most densely populated cities in the world."),n.a.createElement("div",{className:"image"},n.a.createElement(h.a,{fluid:e.data.touchpoints1.childImageSharp.fluid})),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"full-text"},"The dabbawala are an incredible organization of over 5000 people in Mumbai. They deliver nearly 2,00,000 lunches everyday and on time and what is even more impressive is the no usage of any technology. The only motorized transport used is the Mumbai local trains, other than that they make use of hand-drawn carts and bicycles. To satisfy their customers, they use a complex system of collection teams, sorting points and delivery zones, and a completely manual system for routing the right meal to the right destination. This labelling system must rely purely on numbers and colors, painted on the tiffin - because most of the dabbawalas are illiterate and cannot read. Despite challenges like this, the organization has been recognized and celebrated for their amazing order accuracy estimated at roughly 1 error in every 16 million transactions and has resulted in them being recognized by Forbes as being a Six Sigma organization.

To 1.6 million people who have lunch everyday in Mumbai from the dabbawallahs, there are close to 200,000 street and slum children who go without food for days. The Happy Life Welfare society decided to give it a shot and that\'s how the Share My Dabba initiative took off - a new idea for helping to feed Mumbai’s 200,000+ slum children. "Tonnes of food gets left over and uneaten. That amount of food can feed hundreds of children. That is the potential we are trying to work on," It was vital that the solution they developed together was simple, inexpensive, and does not risk delaying the dabbawala’s schedule or their record of on-time delivery.'),n.a.createElement("p",{className:"full-text"},"So here’s how it works; anyone who doesn’t eat all of the food in their lunch can simply place a sticker saying “Share” on the tiffin of uneaten food.The dabbawala picks up the tiffins after lunch as usual, and take them back to a central redistribution location. Here volunteers meet them, quickly separate the tiffins with “Share” stickers, remove the food in them to give to the children, and then quickly repack the tiffins so the dabbawala can get them back to customers’ homes on schedule.

This section can contain food that is packed from the homes specially for these kids. During lunchtime the food in that particular section/compartment will be deliberately left unopened & untouched.
