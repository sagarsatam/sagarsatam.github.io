When I was studying as a product designer, there was not much talk about design thinking, however, now it\'s the word that is getting all of the attention.

I started thinking if I really needed to use them?

Unlike Product Design, Service Design involves intangible/immaterial elements where representing the design process becomes a key activity. And the use of post-its allowed me to represent it visually in a organised manner. This was especially useful in the research phase, as it helped to categorise (colour coordinate) and arrange the different research findings, such as stakeholders and customer journeys, in a more structured way. The easy flexibility of post-its also allow for a quick way to map and capture different elements of a service (for e.g. allows to plot different things in the matrix mapping process and to track any changes).

This flexibility which the post-it provided has changed the way I design, as I am more open now to change, in terms of ideas/concepts.
